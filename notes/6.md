## Reverse an array.

## static (direct invocation of method and variable)

### A static block is used to initialize static variables before the main method runs.

```java
class StaticDemo {
    static int x;
    
    // Static block
    static {
        x = 10;
        System.out.println("Static block executed!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Value of x: " + StaticDemo.x);
    }
}

```

1. Memory efficiency (shared across instances, no extra copies).
2. Utility methods (like Math.max()).

## Method Overloading in Java
Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameters (different number, type, or order of parameters).
