### **Inheritance**

21. **Create a base class `Animal` with a method `makeSound()`. Create derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` that override `makeSound()`.**
22. **Write a program to demonstrate multilevel inheritance with a class `Person`, subclass `Employee`, and another subclass `Manager`.**
23. **Create a `Shape` class with a method `area()`. Derive `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes that override `area()`.**
24. **Create a `Vehicle` class with a method `move()`. Create subclasses `Car` and `Bike` that override `move()`.**
25. **Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of the `super` keyword in method overriding.**
